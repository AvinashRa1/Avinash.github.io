        <p class="para_mus">
            The Ceylon Tea Museum at Hantane, three kilometres from Kandy city is served by a motorable road that circles the museum, provides easy access and adequate parking facilities for cars and tourist coaches. The museum consists of four floors. The ground floor and the second floor exhibit very old items of machinery and the first floor consist of a library and an auditorium with facilities for audio visual presentations. The third floor is allocated to tea sales outlets, where a selection of Sri Lanka's fine tea is available. The entire top floor is a tea cafe. A panoramic view of the Kandy town surrounded by the beautiful Hunasgiriya, Knuckles Range and the Matale range of hills can be viewed through a telescope mounted on the fourth floor. The grounds surrounding the Tea Museum are landscaped with different varieties of teas. Kandy is a mandatory stop virtually on every tourist's itinerary and the location of the Ceylon Tea Museum at Hantane enhances the attraction of the hill country to visitors. Additionally, its proximity to the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens and Loolecondera estate, where tea was first grown commercially in Sri Lanka makes Hantane the perfect location.

        <h3 class="heading_mus">History of the Museum</h3>
        <p class="para_mus">
            A few years ago, some ex-planters were concerned about the tea industry and were keen to impart their knowledge about the industry to the general public and decided to set up a tea museum. Thus in 1975, Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation Chairman Clifford Ratwatte visited the Great Western Tea Factory in Talawakelle and having seen old dismantled machinery suggested to the Superintendent of that factory, Dharmasiri Madugalle, that a Museum should be established immediately to preserve the disused machinery as they were being replaced with modern machinery.
            “Thereafter, I made a note of all the old machinery on my visits to the estates, especially those in Kandy and Matale areas as the oldest tea factories were located there. The project commenced at the end of 1977 after leasing out the abandoned Hantana Tea Factory from the Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB).”
            “It was not an easy task as we had to repair the discarded machinery and make it fit for display. The disused machinery had to be identified and transported to the Museum. It took us (A retired engine driver V. Narayanpillai assisted me in this arduous task) about three years,” said Mr. Dharmasiri Madugalle, Manager Ceylon Tea Museum.
            The Museum is established preserving the atmosphere of a tea factory, at a cost of Rs. 32 million. The Museum project was carried out by the Sri Lanka Tea Board, Tea   Research Institute and the Planters’ Association of Ceylon.
